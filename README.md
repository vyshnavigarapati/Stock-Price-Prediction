# Stock-Price-Prediction
Stock price forecasting using Python, machine learning, and deep learning models for time-series analysis.
This project, Stock Price Prediction, aims to forecast future stock prices using historical market data and machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to analyze patterns and trends in stock price movements and build predictive models that assist in financial decision-making and investment strategies.
The dataset consists of historical stock price data including parameters such as Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.
The project involves extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and data visualization to understand market behavior and remove inconsistencies. Various statistical and machine learning methods are implemented to build reliable forecasting models.
Models used include Linear Regression, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), Random Forest, and ARIMA, each evaluated based on performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). For deep learning implementation, LSTM networks are used to capture long-term dependencies in sequential stock data, providing more accurate time-series predictions.
Key steps in this project include:
Importing and preprocessing stock market data
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for trend visualization
Feature scaling and sequence generation for model training
Building and evaluating ML/DL models for price prediction
Visualizing predicted vs actual stock prices
Technologies and Tools Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
TensorFlow / Keras for LSTM
Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
This project demonstrates the integration of data science, machine learning, and deep learning in financial analytics. 
It serves as a practical example of how AI-driven models can assist investors and analysts in making informed decisions based on data-driven insights.
